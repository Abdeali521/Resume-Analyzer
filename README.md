1. DATA COLLECTION AND PREPROCESSING
Input: Resumes (in different formats like PDF, DOCX, plain text) and job descriptions.
Processing: Convert resumes and job descriptions into text (using libraries like PyPDF2 or python-docx).
Preprocessing: Clean the data by removing irrelevant characters, extra spaces, stop words, and applying tokenization.

2. FEATURE EXTRACTION
Skills Extraction: Use NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) or keyword extraction to pull key skills, education, experience, etc.
Models: Use pre-trained models like spaCy’s NER or custom fine-tuned models for skill recognition.
Text Vectorization: Represent text data using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText.
Resume Parsing: Extract structured data like job titles, companies, duration, education, and skills.

3. SIMILARITY SCORING (RESUME-JOB MATCH)
Cosine Similarity: Compare vectorized resume and job description using cosine similarity to determine the match.
Classification (Optional): Use a binary classifier to categorize resumes as “fit” or “not a fit.”

4. ML/NLP MODEL
Model 1 – Resume-Job Match Scorer:
TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity for matching resumes with job descriptions. That’s a traditional/basic NLP

Model 2 – Skill Extraction:
Utilizes spaCy NER or a fine-tuned NER model to extract relevant skills, education, and experience.

5. BACKEND (API)
Built using Flask or Django.
Endpoints Include:

/upload_resume: Upload and process resumes.

/get_match_score: Compute and return the resume-job match score.

/extract_skills: Extract skills from the resume text.

6. FRONTEND (UI)
Created using React.
User Interaction:

Upload resume (file or text).

Input or choose a job description.

View similarity score and extracted skills.
