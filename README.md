1. DATA COLLECTION AND PREPROCESSING
Input: Resumes (in different formats like PDF, DOCX, plain text) and job descriptions.
Processing: Convert resumes and job descriptions into text (using libraries like PyPDF2 or python-docx).
Preprocessing: Clean the data by removing irrelevant characters, extra spaces, stop words, and applying tokenization.

2. FEATURE EXTRACTION
Skills Extraction: Use NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) or keyword extraction to pull key skills, education, experience, etc.
Models: Use pre-trained models like spaCy’s NER or custom fine-tuned models for skill recognition.
Text Vectorization: Represent text data using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText.
Resume Parsing: Extract structured data like job titles, companies, duration, education, and skills.

3. SIMILARITY SCORING (RESUME-JOB MATCH)
Cosine Similarity: Compare vectorized resume and job description using cosine similarity to determine the match.
Classification (Optional): Use a binary classifier to categorize resumes as “fit” or “not a fit.”

4. ML/NLP MODEL
Model 1 – Resume-Job Match Scorer:
Uses transformer-based models like BERT, RoBERTa, or SBERT to calculate semantic similarity.

Model 2 – Skill Extraction:
Utilizes spaCy NER or a fine-tuned NER model to extract relevant skills, education, and experience.

5. BACKEND (API)
Built using Flask or Django.
Endpoints Include:

/upload_resume: Upload and process resumes.

/get_match_score: Compute and return the resume-job match score.

/extract_skills: Extract skills from the resume text.

6. FRONTEND (UI)
Created using React.
User Interaction:

Upload resume (file or text).

Input or choose a job description.

View similarity score and extracted skills.

DETAILED MODEL ARCHITECTURE
Resume-Job Match Scorer (BERT-based):

Input: Resume and job description text.

Output: A similarity score (0 to 1).

Preprocessing: Tokenization, truncation, padding.

Model: Fine-tuned BERT or SBERT.

Skill Extraction (NER-based):

Input: Resume text.

Output: List of extracted skills (e.g., "Python", "Machine Learning").

Model: spaCy NER or fine-tuned model.

EXAMPLE WORKFLOW
User uploads resume and job description.

Resume and JD text are cleaned and preprocessed.

Skills are extracted using NER.

Similarity score is calculated with ML model.

Results are displayed: match score + suggested improvements.

NEXT STEPS
Data Collection: Build or find datasets of resumes and job descriptions.

Model Training: Fine-tune models for skill extraction and semantic similarity.

Integration: Link frontend and backend using RESTful APIs.

BENEFITS
Helps job seekers tailor resumes for specific job roles.

Provides actionable suggestions to improve resume quality.

Automates the tedious resume screening process.

Improves chances of selection through AI-driven analysis.

Offers recruiters a quick overview of candidate-job fit.
