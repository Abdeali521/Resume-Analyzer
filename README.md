1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Input: Resumes (in different formats like PDF, DOCX, plain text) and job descriptions.

Processing: Convert resumes and job descriptions into text (for PDFs or DOCX, use libraries like PyPDF2 or python-docx).

Preprocessing: Clean the data (removing irrelevant characters, extra spaces, stop words, and applying tokenization).

2. Feature Extraction:
Skills Extraction: Extract key skills, education, experience, and other relevant features using NLP techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) or Keyword Extraction.

Models: You can use pre-trained models like spaCy's NER or custom models fine-tuned for skill recognition.

Text Vectorization: Represent the resumes and job descriptions as feature vectors.

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (using Word2Vec, GloVe, or FastText) can be used to create numerical representations of the text.

Resume Parsing: Extract structured data from resumes, including job titles, companies, duration, education, and skills.

3. Similarity Scoring (Resume-Job Match):
Cosine Similarity or Similarity Score: Once you have the vectorized representation of both the resume and the job description, calculate a cosine similarity score to determine how closely the resume matches the job description.

Classification: If you want to classify resumes based on suitability (e.g., fit vs. not a fit), you can use a binary classifier to predict whether the resume is a good match for a given job.

4. ML/NLP Model:
Model 1: Resume-Job Match Scorer:

This can be based on transformer-based models like BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT for calculating semantic similarity between the job description and the resume.

Fine-tune a pre-trained model using a dataset of job descriptions and corresponding resumes.

You could also use pre-trained embeddings (e.g., SBERT from Sentence-BERT for semantic text similarity).

Model 2: Skill Extraction:

A model for extracting relevant skills, experience, education, and certifications from resumes. spaCy can be a great tool here, or you could fine-tune a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using labeled data.

5. Backend (API):
Flask/Django: Use a backend framework to expose APIs that handle resume processing, job description input, and scoring.

Endpoints:

/upload_resume: Endpoint to upload and process resumes.

/get_match_score: Endpoint to calculate and return the match score between a resume and a job description.

/extract_skills: Endpoint to extract skills from the resume.

6. Frontend (UI):
React: A simple user interface where users can upload resumes and job descriptions, view match scores, and see extracted skills.

Interaction:

Users upload their resume (e.g., as a file or pasted text).

Users input or select the job description.

The app displays the similarity score and extracted features such as skills and experience.

Detailed Model Architecture
Model 1: Resume-Job Match Scorer (BERT-based or Similarity-based)

Input: Resume text and job description text.

Output: A similarity score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a perfect match.

Preprocessing: Tokenization, padding, and truncation.

Model: Fine-tuned BERT or SBERT (Sentence-BERT), which understands semantic meaning.

Model 2: Skill Extraction (NER or Custom Classifier)

Input: Resume text.

Output: A list of extracted skills (e.g., "Python", "Machine Learning", "Data Analysis").

Model: spaCy NER (Named Entity Recognition) or a fine-tuned model to identify and extract skills.

Example Workflow:
Step 1: User uploads resume and job description.

Step 2: Preprocess the text (tokenization, cleaning).

Step 3: Extract skills and features using NER.

Step 4: Compute similarity score using the trained ML model.

Step 5: Display results (match score, extracted skills).

Next Steps:
Data Collection: Gather or create a dataset of resumes and job descriptions for training.

Model Training: Fine-tune pre-trained models on your dataset to improve the accuracy of skill extraction and resume-job match scoring.

Integration: Connect the frontend and backend using API endpoints, making sure to handle file uploads and return the results.
